Based on all the tests i did. I compared result between LRU and FIFO.
My summary is that choosing between LRU and FIFO depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the application or system. 

LRU is generally preferred in scenarios where optimizing for recent access patterns can significantly improve performance, while FIFO is suitable when maintaining strict order or fairness in resource allocation is more critical than performance optimization based on access patterns.
